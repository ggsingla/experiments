# CSS Typewriter Effect

In this small experiment I have implemented the typewriter effect using only **HTML and CSS**.
<br>
<br>

### Concept

> This effect works using the psuedo elements both **::before** and **::after**. A psuedo element covers the whole text initially and then reveals it _one word at a time_ as it moves towards the left completely. The other psuedo element is used as a caret for so that the typing effect looks more realistic. This elements also uses the same animation keyframes along with a simple blinker animation which toggles the opacity form 0 to 100 for realism and to sell the effect in a better way

### Features / Limitations:

- No JavaScript
- Can be implemented by Beginners
- No. of words need to specified separately
- All the text to be animated should be in a single line
