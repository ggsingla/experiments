# Pure CSS tabs
In this small experiment I have implemented a simple 3 tab layout by using only **HTML and CSS**.
<br>
<br>

### Concept
>This can be achieved by using the same **"name"** property for all the input tags that are being used for the tabs themselves. The input tags should be of the type **"radio"**. So that when a tab is selected only one of the radio buttons is active and we can have the CSS properties to be applied when a radio button is checked by using the :checked selector in CSS 

### Features:
* No JavaScript
* Can be implemented by Beginners
* No. of tabs are limited
