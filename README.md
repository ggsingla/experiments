# Experiments

Certain small add-ons to a web page, that I tried for the first time. These are some on test basis things that can be used in big projects by taking some inspiration from here.

### 1. Hacking the Scrollbar
Added a custom scrollbar to a page and tested various attributes realted to make it look awesome.
**Future Planning**
- Will try new changes to it and make it look professional
- Add new pages realted to different topics and showcase different types of scrolls supporting the layout of that kind of page.
